# Online-Streaming-Data-Analysis-with-AI-Enhanced-Insights-

Netflix operates in a highly competitive market with a growing library of TV shows, movies, and documentaries, requiring data analytics to optimize content acquisition and enhance customer engagement. To support these goals, you were tasked with analyzing Netflix's vast dataset to uncover trends in content type, production regions, and popular genres. This analysis aimed to provide insights into what types of content perform well, identify patterns in content production, and inform regional content strategies. Ultimately, the goal was to guide Netflix’s strategic decisions on content acquisition, helping the company better align its offerings with viewer preferences and regional demands.

Task:
Clean and process the Netflix dataset to ensure its readiness for analysis.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in content type, genre, country of production, and release dates.
Develop a Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights for business stakeholders.
Use data to propose content strategy recommendations, focusing on region-specific content production and viewer preferences.
Action:
The project was executed step by step based on the files in the folder:

Data Cleaning (Netflix_dataCleaning.ipynb):

The raw Netflix dataset (netflix_titles.csv) had missing values, inconsistencies in data formats, and some duplicates.
Using the Netflix_dataCleaning.ipynb Jupyter notebook, you performed the following actions:
Handled missing values by either filling or removing incomplete records.
Removed duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
Standardized columns such as release_year, country, and listed_in to make analysis easier.
Saved the cleaned data as cleaned_data.csv, which was the basis for further analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Netflix_dataAnalysis.ipynb):

After cleaning the data, you used the Netflix_dataAnalysis.ipynb notebook for analysis:
Content Type Analysis: Determined the distribution between Movies and TV Shows in Netflix’s library. Results showed Movies dominated but TV Shows were gaining momentum in recent years.
Genre Analysis: Identified popular genres across different content types, such as Dramas and Comedies, that perform well across regions.
Country-Specific Analysis: Evaluated which countries contribute the most content, with a focus on regions like the US, India, and the UK.
Release Year Trends: Tracked content production over time, noting a significant increase in original content after 2015.
Visualized key insights using Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib, with results saved for later integration into the dashboard.
Dashboard Development (dashboard.pbix):

Using the insights from the analysis, you built a Power BI dashboard (dashboard.pbix), which provided:
Content Type Distribution: An overview of how much of Netflix’s library consists of Movies vs. TV Shows.
Top Genres by Region: A breakdown of the most popular genres in each country, helping Netflix target its content strategy geographically.
Country Contribution: A map visual highlighting the key content-producing regions, providing insights into where Netflix could focus its production efforts.
Time Trends: A line chart showing the rise in content production, especially Netflix Originals, over the last decade.
The dashboard was designed for Netflix business leaders to explore content trends interactively and make data-driven decisions.
Assets and Visual Enhancements (assets folder):

You incorporated Netflix branding into the dashboard and reports using logos and backgrounds from the assets folder. This ensured the presentation was professional and aligned with Netflix’s visual identity.
These assets were embedded into the Power BI dashboard and final presentation materials, making it suitable for executive-level briefings.
Result:
Optimized Content Strategy: The analysis provided Netflix with a clearer understanding of content type performance (Movies vs. TV Shows), helping the content acquisition team focus on high-performing genres and types.
Regional Insights: The analysis of country-level content trends revealed opportunities for Netflix to expand its content offerings in high-production regions like India and the US, while also identifying potential growth areas in underrepresented markets.
Actionable Dashboard: The Power BI dashboard allowed Netflix executives to explore data interactively, supporting strategic decisions about content acquisition and marketing efforts in specific regions.
Business Impact: The data-driven insights delivered by this project helped Netflix align its content strategy with viewer preferences, potentially increasing subscriber engagement and driving revenue growth through better-targeted content investments.
